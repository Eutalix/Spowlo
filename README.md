## ‚ú® Community Revitalization! ‚ú®
Hello Spowlo enthusiasts!

This project was left in an unmaintained state, and its core functionality was broken due to outdated dependencies. As a fan of the app, I've taken the initiative to update and stabilize it to ensure it remains usable for the community.

The app has been successfully updated to use the latest `spotdl` engine, and the main download feature (via in-app search) is now fully functional again! The project has also been stabilized with a modern CI/CD pipeline for automated releases.

This is now a community-driven effort. If you're a developer, your contributions are more than welcome to help fix the remaining bugs and add new features.

**Current Status:**
*   ‚úÖ **Downloads via Search:** Working perfectly.
*   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pasting Links:** This feature is currently broken and is the main priority. Help is wanted!

Let's work together to keep this great project alive! Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Spowlo uses YT Music and YouTube to download the songs. This is because Spotify DRM bypassing can lead to an account ban and legal issues. If YT Music isn't available in your country, don't worry, you can still use YouTube as audio provider or use a VPN. We are working on making a regional bypass so don't matter your region. Thank you for understanding.

## üîÆ Features

- Download songs from Spotify thanks to the [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/) library.

- Downloading without links, just a search query 

- Download full playlists with just one click.

- Embed synced lyrics into the downloaded songs.

- Easy to use and user-friendly.

- [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) style UI, with dynamic color theme.

- MAD: UI and logic written purely on Kotlin. It's used just an activity and composable destinations and deep links thanks to the navigation library.

## ‚¨áÔ∏èDownload

- Download the latest version from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Eutalix/Spowlo/releases/latest).

**Note:** The current builds are optimized for `arm64-v8a` devices (most modern phones). Support for older `armeabi-v7a` devices is not guaranteed as the required Python environment for it was incomplete in the original project.

## üìñCredits

A special thanks to the community members and projects that made this app possible. The following are the credits from the original developer, which we gratefully preserve:

> Thanks to [xnetcat](https://github.com/xnetcat) for it's help with some spotDL related things!
>
> Thanks to [Seal](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal) and [JunkFood02](https://github.com/JunkFood02) for some of the code of the app and UI ideas. (Without you, this app would not have existed). I learnt a lot about architectures, corroutines, Jetpack Compose...

> [Philipp Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/c/PhilippLackner). Infinite thanks to you, Philipp. You made me learn infinite things with just a few videos. This guy explains literally everything about what is he coding, make apps just to make the community learn, and give us some amazing utilities. Without he, probably I wouldn't started coding for Android.
